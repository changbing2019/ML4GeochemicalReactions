1) rerun Case 3 of Case_CaO_SiO2_H2O as Case 3_1 to check how pH simulation is improved
2) rerun Case 3 f Case_CaO_SiO2_H2O as Case 3_2 to check how Si(aq) is improved

3) 5 Cementitious System were modeled with the randomforest classifier to group the dataset

4) preprocessing the datasets of the uranium chemical system
5) preliminary modeling for the Uranium with 5K dataset
